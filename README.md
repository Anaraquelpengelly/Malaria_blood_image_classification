# malaria_blood_image_class
This is a machine learning project to create a model that will be able to determine if blood samples are infected with the malaria parasite (P. falciparum).

Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. The smartphoneâ€™s built-in camera acquired images of slides for each microscopic field of view. The images were manually annotated by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. The de-identified images and annotations are archived at NLM (IRB#12972). We applied a level-set based algorithm to detect and segment the red blood cells. The dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells
